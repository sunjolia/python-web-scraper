# python-web-scraper

Simple tool to send myself an email of job openings for companies that don't have recruiting timelines posted, require continuously checking back on the website, or require following on Twitter for job updates (don't have a Twitter).

Currently saves jobs of interest to a csv file.

TODO:
- Change csv destination to sending an email
- Add link to posting 
- Add more sites of interest to scrape
